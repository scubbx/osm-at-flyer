This repository holds a redesign of the original German OpenStreetMap flyer done in Scribus.

# Origin

The original design originates from https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-promotional-leaflets.

# Changes

* The text was adapted to fit Austria
* Images were replaced by ones showing regions in Austria
* The software used is Scribus, NOT Inkscape.

# License

As with the original flyer, all contents are in the public domain except for those derived from OSM 
which are CC BY-SA.
